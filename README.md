# CTFdeployer
## A CTFd deployment bot
Why did I make this?
I felt like wasting my time while deploying challenges, because CSS, images, fonts, ...etc have to load when using the browser, and when the network is too busy, it takes alot of time.
Instead, why wouldn't we interact directly with the JSon API? Well, that's what the script does.

This is the very first version, it allows to deploy all the challenges in less than 30 seconds, hide/unhide challenges and delete challenges.
